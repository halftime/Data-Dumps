# Belgium soft sportbooks, an overview

**Shoutout to (one of) the most useless regulatory instutution(s) in Belgium!**

The Gaming Commission (GC) was established by the Gambling Act of 7 May 1999. The GC is the official regulator of the gambling sector. 

**The GC is lobbied, and backdoor funded by the sportsbooks themselves. Even the NATIONAL LOTTERY is involved as they operate the sportsbook Scooore**
